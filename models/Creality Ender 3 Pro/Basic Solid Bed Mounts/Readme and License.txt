CR-10/Ender3 Mount Notes:

The Strain arm will only work on the CR-10, Ender3, and CR-10 S4. You can also just print the round bed spacer for use on other machines. 

MUST BE PRINTED IN ABS. PETG and PLA will NOT work. If you cannot print ABS you cannot print ABS we offer solid mounts for the Tornado and ALL CR-10 Machines on the site. 

Our CR-10 (all models) mounts have an aluminum core for maximum durability and stability.
